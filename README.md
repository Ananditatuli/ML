# Kmeans clustering model-shopping
In this project, a clustering algorithm is applied to analyze a customer dataset, encompassing key attributes such as customer ID, gender, age, annual income, and spending score. The primary objective of this analysis is to discern spending behaviors among customers based on their income ranges. To achieve this, I have utilized a clustering algorithm to create clusters that visually represent distinct spending patterns, thereby facilitating a more insightful analysis.

To enhance the clarity and precision of findings, a select set of attributes are focused upon that significantly influence the outcome. These chosen attributes help streamline our analysis process, enabling us to derive more meaningful and actionable insights from the dataset.
